# 📈 Sine and Cosine Functions Plot

This project visualizes the **Sine** and **Cosine** functions using **Python** and **Matplotlib**. It is designed to demonstrate the mathematical relationship between these two fundamental trigonometric functions and provide a clear graphical representation.

---

## 🌟 Features

* Plots **Sine** and **Cosine** curves on the same graph.
* Differentiates curves using **colors** and **labels**.
* Displays a **grid** for easier interpretation of values.
* Includes **titles, axis labels, and legends** for clarity.
* Adjustable **figure size** for better visualization.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python** – Programming language for computation and plotting.
* **NumPy** – For generating values of x over a defined range.
* **Matplotlib** – For plotting sine and cosine functions.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anum-349/sin_cos-graph.git
cd sin_cos-graph
```

2. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

3. **Run the script**:

```bash
python create_graphs.py
```

4. **View the plot** – The Sine and Cosine functions will be displayed in a window.
